# Learning-Path-Projects
A collection of hands-on projects from my learning journey in data analytics and business intelligence. Includes SQL queries for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis, along with interactive dashboards built in Tableau and Excel.

## Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions | PostgreSQL and Tableau
In this portfolio project, I explore global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data for all world countries, sourced from the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR). The analysis covers emissions data from 1970 to 2022, focusing on CO2, CH4, N2O, and F-gases, and includes a breakdown by country and sector. Additionally, GNI per capita data from the World Bank is used to classify countries by income levels, providing a comprehensive perspective on global emissions trends.

Key questions:
1. Total GHG emissions by income class in 2022.
2. The top 10 highest-emitting countries from 2010 to 2022.
3. Sector contributions to emissions from 2000 to 2022.
4. Proportional emissions by substance for the United States and China in 2022.

The dataset offers many interesting insights that can be uncovered.

## Coffee Store Analysis | PostgreSQL and Tableau
This project focuses on analyzing an online coffee store’s sales data to uncover critical business insights, such as growth trends, product preferences, and profitability. The analysis also evaluates the effectiveness of the company’s customer loyalty program in boosting retention rates. The project concludes with actionable recommendations for improving business performance and features an interactive Tableau dashboard that allows business owners to uncover further insights on their own.
